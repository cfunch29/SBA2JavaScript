# SBA2 - JavaScript Fundamentals 
## Goal 
- Create a function named getLearnerData() that accepts these values as parameters, in the order listed: (CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, [LearnerSubmission]), and returns the formatted result, which should be an array of objects as described above.

- Your goal is to analyze and transform this data such that the output of your program is an array of objects, each containing the following information in the following format:
    - "id": number. 
    - "avg": number 
    - <assignment_id>: number, 

## My Process 
1. Loop through assignments and keep the assignment that are due before 2025 (skip the future assignment that learner 1 submitted)
